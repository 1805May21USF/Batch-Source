README: ALEX PATTON

This is project 0. I implemented a banking application fufilling all of the listed requirements so far as I can tell. 
I used Maven to get junit and log4j, so the project needs to be imported as a maven project.

RUNNING:
Simply run the program. It will output information on its use when it is run. 
PLEASE BE ADVISED: only one word/number is allowed per line. 
For example, if one wants to deposit 25 dollars in bob's account, one would type:
		
		deposit
		bob
		25

It would not be: deposit bob 25
